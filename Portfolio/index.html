            <p>My name is Daniel Cheishvili and I am currently a John Abbott student
            studying computer sciences. I really enjoy making website and object orienated programming.
            I would either like to work as a website developer for a company or work in a cybersecrurity field.
            All though I am still learning, I really enjoy challenging myself and exploring new topics in this field. <br>
            <br>
            In less formal things, I was born in Kazakshtan, grew up in Israel and been living in Montreal for 9 years.
            I enjoy doing Martial Arts, and playing video games. If you ever want me to do something or 
            win me over, just give me sushi or souvlaki and I'll do anything.</p>
